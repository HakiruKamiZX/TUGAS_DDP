This solution reads the input, calculates the RPI rating for each team using the formula provided in the problem statement, and outputs the results in the required format.

The input format for the problem is as follows:

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
The following T lines each represent a test case, and contain the following:
An integer N, the number of teams in the league.
N lines, each containing two integers w and l, representing the number of wins and losses for a particular team.
The output format for the problem is as follows:

T lines, each representing a test case and containing the following:
The string "Case #x:", where x is the test case number (starting from 1).
N space-separated values, representing the RPI ratings of the teams in the league.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
